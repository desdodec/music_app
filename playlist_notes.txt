//////////////////////sidebar playlist load create display delete//////////////////////


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////




to make it simpler I already have some playlists in the db - to display the plalist results we use exactly the same method as we do for the main search results window but we apply this query instead:


SELECT ts.*, p.name  -- Add columns from playlist as needed
FROM tracks_search ts
JOIN playlist_Tracks pt ON ts.id = pt.track_id
JOIN playlists p ON pt.playlist_id = p.id  -- Join with the playlist table
WHERE p.name = 'Playlist1';


the playlist name should be attached to the particular playlist button

so the first thing we do is load the playlists and create a sidebae playlist button for each playlis - don't do anything else


"id"	"integer"	"nextval('playlists_id_seq'::regclass)"	"NO"
"created_at"	"timestamp without time zone"	"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"	"YES"
"name"	"text"		"NO"


"id"	"integer"	"nextval('playlist_tracks_id_seq'::regclass)"	"NO"
"playlist_id"	"integer"		"YES"
"duration"	"integer"		"YES"
"title"	"text"		"YES"
"library"	"text"		"YES"
"cd_title"	"text"		"YES"
"filename"	"text"		"YES"
"track_id"	"text"		"NO"
